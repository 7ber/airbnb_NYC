# Springboard Data Science Track /n Capstone Project-1

# airbnb_NYC
#### This dataset is going to be used to create a model that explores pricing metrics in NYC and predicts rental prices for the upcoming period.
# Targeted stakeholders are:
-NYC Housing Authority \n -Tourism Tour Organizations while accounting their tour costs \n -Tourists planning to visit NYC \n -Airbnb App users \n -Airbnb Hosts And Potential Hosts while balancing their rent prices   -Airbnb Application Improvers -Other Hosting Application Member Users(such as Booking.com) -NewBie Hosting Application Startup Investors.

# Method/Technique:
1)EDA/Visualization -Comparing boroughs, locations, geographical features -Comparing hosts, number of their lists -Comparing reviews and their quantity 2)Hypothesis testing (t-test, z-test) -Analysing data above and creating hypothesis e.g: is mean price in borough 1 difference from borough 2 3)Machine Learning -Regression models for predicting listing price
# Deliverable:
-Github Repository via Jupyter Notebook includes codes I create and comments for reasoning. -Power Point Slide including Data Visualisation images. -Milestone report -Final Report -Slide Deck
